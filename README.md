# Kaltura Account Dump API Script
This script loops through all entries, categories and chosen metadata profile (or filtered list of entries) in a specified Kaltura account. It then saves the entry and metadata fields (Entry per line) into an Excel (XML format) file.

# Configurations and running the script
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Kaltura PHP 5.3+ API Client archive](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Client_Libraries) and extract into the /kaltura-client directory
2. Open the accountdump.php file, and configure the following parameters:  
	* PARTNER_ID: The Kaltura Account Partner ID
	* PARTNER_NAME: The Name of the Account for logging (this doesn't really influence anything but logging...)
	* ADMIN_SECRET: The Kaltura Account ADMIN Secret (The script must run with Admin KS)
	* SERVICE_URL: The full base URL to the Kaltura server API endpoint
	* KS_EXPIRY_TIME: How long in seconds should the Kaltura session be? Preferably this should be set to long, since this script may run for a while if the account has many entries.
	* ENTRY_STATUS_IN: Defines the entry statuses to retrieve  
	* ENTRY_TYPE_IN: Defines the entry types to retrieve 
	* ENTRY_FIELDS: The list of entry fields to export (excluding custom metadata, that is set in METADATA_PROFILE_ID), entryId, captions and categories will be added to this list
	* PARENT_CATEGORIES: Any IDs of Kaltura Categories you'd like to limit the export to
	* FILTER_TAGS: Any tags to filter by (tagsMultiLikeOr)
	* DEBUG_PRINTS: Set to true if you'd like the script to output logging to the console (this is different from the KalturaLogger)
	* CYCLE_SIZES: This decides how many entries will be processed in each multi-request call - set it to whatever number works best for your serve
	r, generally 300 should be a good number.
	* METADATA_PROFILE_ID: The profile id of the custom metadata profile to get its fields per entry
	* ONLY_CAPTIONED_ENTRIES: Should only entries that have caption assets be included in the output?
	* GET_CAPTION_URLS: Should the excel include URLs to download caption assets?
	* ERROR_LOG_FILE: The name of the KalturaLogger export file
	* STOP_DATE_FOR_EXPORT: Defines a stop date for the entries iteration loop. Any time string supported by strtotime can be passed. If this is set to null or -1, it will be ignored and the script will run through the entire library until it reaches the first created entry. e.g. '45 days ago' or '01/01/2017', etc. formats supported by strtotime
	* $exportFileName: This sets the name of the output excel file (without .xsl extension).
  
After setting the values for the above parameters in accountdump.php, run the script using PHP CLI:  
```
$ php accountdump.php
```
